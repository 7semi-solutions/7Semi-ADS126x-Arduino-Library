# 7Semi-ADS126x-Arduino-Library

This Arduino library provides unified support for the **7Semi ADS1262 (10-channel)** and **7Semi ADS1263 (32-channel)** 32-bit precision ADC boards via SPI. Both boards are based on the Texas Instruments ADS126x series, ideal for high-resolution, low-noise, and multi-channel analog data acquisition.
